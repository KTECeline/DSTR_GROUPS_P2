Role,Suggested DS,Why? (Justify in Comments),Implementation Tip
1: Patient Admission Clerk,Queue (FIFO),"Admit adds to end, discharge removes from front (earliest patient first). View shows queue order.","Array-based queue: Fixed size (e.g., 100 patients). Struct for Patient {int id; string name, condition;}."
2: Medical Supply Manager,Stack (LIFO),"""Use Last Added"" = pop top (most recent supply first, like shelf restocking). Add = push. View = traverse stack.",Linked list-based stack for dynamic sizes (batches vary). Struct for Supply {string type; int qty; string batch;}.
3: Emergency Dept Officer,Priority Queue,Log adds with priority level; process highest first. View in priority order.,"Array-based with heap (or simple sorted array for small size). Higher priority = smaller number (e.g., 1=critical). Struct for Emergency {string name, type; int priority;}."
4: Ambulance Dispatcher,Circular Queue,Register adds to queue; rotate shifts in cycle (fair rotation without data loss). Display shows current order.,Array-based circular queue (reuse slots for continuous duty). Struct for Ambulance {string id; bool onDuty;}.
